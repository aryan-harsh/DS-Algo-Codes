#### Navigating the repo
• This repository consists of codes (currently in C/C++) from various websites like : Interviewbit , GeeksforGeeks etc. 
• For each website, there is / will be a corresponding folder, with subfolders for various topics like Arrays, Linked lIsts, Graphs etc.
• Inside each folder the code for a particular problem statement can be found. The name is the same as that on the respective website
